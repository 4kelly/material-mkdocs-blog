# How to blog with [Material MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/)

## [Demo](https://material-mkdocs-blog.4kelly.com/) | [Instructions](https://material-mkdocs-blog.4kelly.com/setup/)

[MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org) is a static site generator. 
[Material MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) is a theme for MkDocs.
MkDocs has no built-in support for blogging, but it is extensible enough to easily add your own.
This repo is the experimental precursor to a MkDocs [plugin](https://www.mkdocs.org/dev-guide/plugins/), 
if there is demand.
